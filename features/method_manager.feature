Feature: manage methods and ontology

  as a biotechnology protocols/methods expert
  I want to create and edit methods and the method ontology (MO)
  so that I can run user experiments with method chains 

  Background:
    Given the Methods collection exists
    And the Methods collection contains methods
    And the Methods are listed on the homepage
    And the ontology is shown on the homepage

  Scenario: add new method

  Scenario: edit how methods relate

  Scenario: edit the ontology (how terms relate) 

  Scenario: print method cards

  Scenario: use wit.ai
